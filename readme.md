Equity One Property Maps

## Description ##

Equity One asked me to convert their flash interactive property maps to an Html5 solution. In addition to the conversion I built a custom image generator that exported the necessary web optimized assets directly from Adobe Illustrator. The generator saved the company time when new properties were added and also cut down on the possiblity of human error. Both portions of the application are compiled from CoffeeScript source code.
